**CobbleGen** is a simple mod that allows you to customize cobblestone, stone, and basalt generator.

:::tip
CobbleGen is a server-side mod, but if you install CobbleGen on client-side you'll be able to use recipe viewer (REI/JEI/EMI) to see the configured generators.

:::caution
I only published my mods on CurseForge and/or Modrinth, downloading any of my mod from a different source may put you at risk of downloading malware.
