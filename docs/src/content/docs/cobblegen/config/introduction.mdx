:::note
You can use [CobbleGen Configurator WebApp](https://cobblegen.aap.my.id) instead if you don't want to configure the config files manually.

:::tip
CobbleGen uses a more lenient format of JSON called [HJSON](https://hjson.github.io/)/[JSON5](https://json5.org/), meaning you don't need to care that much about the comma and stuff.
:::

There are 2 config files for CobbleGen:
- `cobblegen.json5` - Where you define the generators
- `cobblegen-meta.json5` - To configure CobbleGen's behaviour

Every config file must be wrapped by `{}` otherwise it won't be valid, for example:

```json5
{
  "cobbleGen": [
    {
      "id": "minecraft:cobblestone",
      "weight": 100.0
    }
  ],
  // Be sure to define the config format version to prevent breakage in the future
  "formatVersion": "1.1"
}
```
  </TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Format v2.x">
In the future, CobbleGen will start using [TOML](https://toml.io/) instead of JSON to make it a lot easier for people to write the config. Check out [GH-53](https://github.com/null2264/CobbleGen/issues/53) for the latest draft.

There are 2 config files for CobbleGen:
- `cobblegen.toml` - Where you define the generators
- `cobblegen-meta.toml` - To configure CobbleGen's behaviour

```toml
[[cobblegen]]
id = "minecraft:cobblestone"
weight = 100.0
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
