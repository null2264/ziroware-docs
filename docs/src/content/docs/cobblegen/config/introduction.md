:::note
You can use [CobbleGen Configurator WebApp](https://cobblegen.aap.my.id) instead if you don't want to configure the JSON files manually.
:::

:::tip
CobbleGen uses a more lenient format of JSON called [HJSON](https://hjson.github.io/)/[JSON5](https://json5.org/), meaning you don't need to care that much about the comma and stuff.
:::

There are 2 config files for CobbleGen:
- `cobblegen.json5` - Where you define the generators
- `cobblegen-meta.json5` - To configure CobbleGen's behaviour

## External links

- [json-5.com](https://json-5.com) - Online JSON(5) validation and formatter, in case you don't want to install any software
